# Text-Analytics-NLP

This project was part of the Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)course in MsBAN program at Hult International Business School. The project aimed to collect information -- which can be extracted via the Twitter R library -- and analyze the text data in R using at least 3 frameworks. 

### Project description
The current study seeks to determine how to improve travel experiences that would help stimulate the financial recovery of the airline industry, specifically that of United Airlines. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the aviation sector has been severely affected by government-imposed restrictions and widespread anxiety among travelers. As a result, the industry has faced a significant loss in revenue, with United Airlines losing around $1.96B in 20211. Using Twitter API and the frameworks of Sentiment Analysis, TF-IDF, and Correlograms, it aims to explore customer sentiments and the associations of United Airlines against its major competitors -- i.e., Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines.
